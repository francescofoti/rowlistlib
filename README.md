rowlistlib
==========

A COM library implementing easy to use, searchable and sortable in memory multi-column lists and row objects, well suited to work with disconnected database recordsets.

Release notes
=============

GPL v2: the modules sources still don't reference the license; they're all released in GPL v2.

The VBA2013 subdirectory contains an Access 2013 database with the library testdriver's modules.

This is a 32 and 64 bits compatible library.

Open RowListLibVBATestDriver.accdb with Access, go to VBA's debug window (CTRL+G) and type "Main" (without quotes) and then ENTER.
NB: When the database opens, you'll have to authorize it for running macros (see the yellow warning bar that appears under the ribbon).
